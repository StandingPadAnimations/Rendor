# Rendor
GitHub for the Rendor programming language

Rendor is the successor to the EnderKnight programming language. It aims to fix certain bugs and add:
* Actual functions with arguments and return statements
* Updating variables
* Scopes
* Converting variables from string to their actual values
* C++ inspired syntax
* Better if statements
* Operators such as or(|), and(&), and modulo(%)
* Bytecode
* Better lexer
* Better parser
* C++17 features
# Compiling requirements for building from source:
* You have to compile using a C++17 compatible compiler. On Linux, Mac, and Windows(using gcc and make) you can use the make file 
* Boost 1.77 is a required dependency(You may need to edit the makefile's BOOSTFILE and BOOSTSYS variables)
