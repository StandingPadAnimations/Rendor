Rendor is the successor to the EnderKnight programming language. It aims to fix certain bugs and add:
* Actual functions with arguments and return statements -> Arguments: Done, Return: WIP
* Updating variables -> Done
* Scopes -> Done
* Converting variables from string to their actual values -> Done
* C++ inspired syntax -> WIP
* Better if statements
* Operators such as or, and, and modulo(%)
* Bytecode -> WIP
* Better lexer -> Done
* Better parser
* C++20 features(in the interpreter and compiler)
* Incrementing and decrementing -> WIP

Officially this is called the Rendor Engine, named after the term render engine(since autocorrect always corrects Rendor to render)
# Compiling requirements for building from source:
* You have to compile using a C++20 compatible compiler. On Linux, Mac, and Windows(using gcc and make) you can use the make file 
* Boost 1.77 and fmt 8.1.1 are required dependencies 
* You must be able to use the std::filesystem library
